PyDeepSee
=========
Python library for [Solera DeepSee](http://www.soleranetworks.com/products/deepsee/features/) network forensics appliance.  python library is designed for administrators of DeepSee that need some automation in their life. 


DeepSee API (inexplicably) lacks a proper library in any language. Because of that, I got tired of copy/pasting the same scraps of code putting hacky apps. 


The primary focus of the library will to provide direct API to Python functions, with some extra fluff to save time as needed, such as `reportDone()`, `reportWaitDone()`, `activeInterfaces()`, and more.
